<h1 align='center' >Telegram bot on Typescript & Telegraf.js</h1>
<h2 align=''>This is another branch of my Telegram Bot. The original version of it doesn't have Prisma, but this vesion has. Honestly, previous version works better than this, but in previous version all data saves in a TypeScript file - all keyboards, localization, database with all names of dishes, their descriptions. But, it works stable. Very often I have an error "Bad HTTP request, when I'm trying to load images of dishes from Prisma, and there is no my fault. This is a problem of Prisma, and I have no idea how to fix it.</h2>
