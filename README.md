<h1 align='center' >Telegram bot on Typescript & Telegraf.js</h1>
<h2 align=''>It's a simple Telegram bot for ordering food from a restaurant or a cafe. This bot was written on TypeScript only and also I used library "Telegraf JS" (it works on TypeScript).</h2>
<br>
<h2 align=''>The structure of the bot is very simple: main file is "bot.ts", all keyboards and a database, which contains all food and drinks. There are Inline keyboards (with callback) and Reply keyboards (without callback, they send a message after pressing the button). Also, there are array "busket" in a "bot.ts" with strange work logic, but it works and that's the main point. Also, check my another repos</h2>
